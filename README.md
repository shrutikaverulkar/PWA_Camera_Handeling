# Awesome Camera Handling

The progressive web app (PWA) camera feature allows users to access their device's camera directly from a web app, with the ability to open and close the camera, switch between front and rear cameras, and take photos.

To open the camera, the user simply needs to click on the camera icon or button within the PWA. This will launch the camera interface, which will display a live feed of the device's camera. The user can then use the PWA to adjust settings such as focus, exposure, and flash, as well as to switch between the front and rear cameras.

Once the camera is open and the user is ready to take a photo, they can click the shutter button within the PWA to capture the image. The image is then saved to the device's photo gallery or other designated location, depending on the settings within the PWA.

If the user wants to switch between front and rear cameras while using the camera feature within the PWA, they can click the camera switch icon within the camera interface. This will toggle the camera from front-facing to rear-facing or vice versa.

Finally, to close the camera within the PWA, the user can simply click the close camera button or icon within the interface. This will return the user to the main screen of the PWA and close the camera interface.

Overall, the PWA camera feature offers users a convenient and seamless way to access their device's camera from within a web app, with the ability to take photos, adjust settings, switch cameras, and close the camera interface when they are done.
